We have retired WCAG 2.2 callouts and guidance across the Design System website.

The callouts were designed to make teams aware of the changes to WCAG 2.2 and help them make necessary adjustments to their services before October 2024. This was the date that public sector bodies needed to be compliant with the WCAG 2.2 updates to the accessibility regulations. Now that this date has passed we have removed the callouts and brought specific messages into our overall guidance where itâ€™s useful.

Let us know if you are missing any particular information in our [announcement of the WCAG 2.2 callout retirement](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system/discussions/4697).
