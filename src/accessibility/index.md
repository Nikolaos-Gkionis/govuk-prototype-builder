Our work to make the GOV.UK Design System meet public sector accessibility regulations is a continuous and iterative process.

Using the GOV.UK Design System in a service does not immediately make that service accessible. Youâ€™ll need additional research, design, development and testing work to make sure your service is accessible, even when using accessible styles, components and patterns.

## Accessibility strategy

[Read our accessibility strategy](/accessibility/accessibility-strategy/) for more information on our current principles and work needed to improve the accessibility of the GOV.UK Design System.

## Accessibility statement

[Our accessibility statement](/accessibility-statement/) helps not just end users but also service teams to understand how accessibile GOV.UK Frontend, its documentation website and this website are.

## Accessibility in the Service Manual

The [Accessibility and assisted digital guidance in the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service) outlines what you need to know and what you need to do to ensure your service is accessible.
