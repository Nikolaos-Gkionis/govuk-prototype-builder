Our work to make the GOV.UK Design System meet public sector accessibility regulations is a continuous and iterative process. You must [make sure your service is accessible](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps). We outline our approach on [our accessibility strategy](/accessibility/accessibility-strategy/).

Using the GOV.UK Design System in a service does not immediately make that service accessible. Youâ€™ll need additional research, design, development and testing work to make sure your service is accessible, even when using accessible styles, components and patterns.

## Accessibility strategy

[Read our accessibility strategy](/accessibility/accessibility-strategy/) for more information on our current principles and work needed to improve the accessibility of the GOV.UK Design System.
