# GOV.UK Prototype Builder - Progress Tracking

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

Building a point-and-click interface for creating GOV.UK prototypes without coding.

## ✅ **Completed Tasks**

### Task 1: Monorepo Setup ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Description**: Create a monorepo with apps (studio) and packages (schema, renderer, exporter, ai, utils)
- **Achievements**:
  - Set up pnpm + Turborepo workspace
  - Created proper directory structure
  - Initialized CI (GitHub Actions), EditorConfig, Prettier/ESLint

### Task 3: Domain Schema ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Description**: Single source of truth for the builder, preview, and exporter
- **Achievements**:
  - Defined Project, Page, Field, Condition interfaces
  - Implemented Zod schemas + TypeScript types
  - Used JSONLogic for portable condition expressions

### Task 4: Page-Type Catalogue ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Description**: Curate supported pages for v1 and map to templates
- **Achievements**:
  - V1 page types: start, content, question, task list, check answers, confirmation
  - Extensible via registry (id → template + field map)
  - Documented mapping rules and required props

### Task 5: Studio App (Next.js) ✅

- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Description**: Developer UI for point-and-click building
- **Achievements**:
  - Next.js app with App Router and Tailwind CSS
  - Modern studio interface differentiated from prototype output
  - Working pages: Dashboard, Project creation form, Templates gallery
  - Form components: Custom radio cards, styled inputs, buttons
  - Responsive design with proper spacing and typography
  - Integration setup for GOV.UK Design System components
  - Fixed React hydration errors and build issues

### Task 6: Visual Journey Editor (Prototype Builder) ✅

- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Description**: Interactive drag-and-drop interface for building prototype journeys
- **Achievements**:
  - Built complete visual journey editor with drag & drop functionality
  - Page types: Start, Content, Question, Check Answers, Confirmation
  - Interactive canvas with page positioning and selection
  - Page title editing and deletion capabilities
  - Visual page type indicators with colors and icons
  - Responsive sidebar with page palette
  - Toolbar with save/preview functionality
  - Connection lines between pages (ready for branching logic)

## 🚧 **Next Priority: Task 7 - Condition Builder UX**

### What We'll Build Next:

- **Visual Rule Builder**: Field/answer selectors → JSONLogic AST
- **Condition Types**: Support equals, contains, greater/less, any/all
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Provide evaluation against sample answers
- **Branching Logic**: Connect pages with conditional flows

### Implementation Plan:

1. **Condition Panel**: Add condition creation interface to selected pages
2. **Rule Builder**: Visual interface for building JSONLogic expressions
3. **Connection Management**: Handle conditional connections between pages
4. **Validation**: Ensure logical flow and prevent circular references

## 🎉 **Today's Major Achievement**

We successfully built the **core prototype builder interface**! Users can now:

- Drag page types onto a canvas
- Position and organize their prototype flow
- Edit page titles and manage page lifecycle
- See a visual representation of their journey

This is the foundation that makes the entire project viable - users can now build prototypes visually without touching code!

## 📁 **File Structure Created**

```
apps/studio/src/app/components/journey-editor/
├── JourneyEditor.tsx      # Main editor component
├── JourneyCanvas.tsx      # Canvas for page positioning
├── PageNode.tsx          # Individual page representation
├── PagePalette.tsx       # Sidebar with draggable page types
└── ConnectionLine.tsx    # Visual connections between pages

apps/studio/src/types/
└── prototype.ts          # TypeScript interfaces for the system

apps/studio/src/app/builder/
└── page.tsx             # Builder route (/builder)
```

## 🚀 **Ready for Next Session**

The journey editor is fully functional and ready for the next phase. We can now focus on:

1. **Condition building** for creating branching logic
2. **Page configuration** for setting up fields and content
3. **Live preview** functionality
4. **Export system** for generating actual prototype code

**Great work today!** 🎯
